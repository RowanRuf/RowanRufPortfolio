        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Rowan Ruf, a passionate Software Engineering student at Stevens Institute of Technology with a minor in Computer Science. Originally from New Jersey, I have always been fascinated by technology, problem-solving, and creative development.
            My journey began with game development in Unity, where I honed my skills in C# and game design. Over the years, I've expanded my expertise into mobile app development (React Native, JavaScript, OpenAI), Virtual Reality experiences (C#, UnityXR), and even creating this website (html).
            Beyond coding, I'm currently involved with Engineers Without Borders, where I contribute to real-world engineering challenges such as designing and implementing a new water distribution system for a native community in Peru.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal is to secure a position in software development where I can apply my programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity to build innovative solutions. Whether it's designing immersive games, creating efficient software solutions, or exploring AI-powered tools, I'm always eager to learn and improve.
